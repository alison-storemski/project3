<p1><strong>Clarence Greenwood AKA Citizen Cope</strong><br>
In 2000, Citizen Cope signed with DreamWorks and released a self-titled album.<br>
In 2004, he released The Clarence Greenwood Recordings, which he also produced. <br>
Every Waking Moment followed in 2006 (also self-produced), and debuted at #69 on the Billboard 200 chart.<br>
In 2007, he featured on the soundtrack of Trouble the Water alongside Massive Attack, Mary Mary, John Lee Hooker, The Roots, Dr. John and Blackkoldmadina. <br>
In 2010, Clarence established his own record label, <b>Rainwater Recordings</b>.<br> 
The move allowed him full creative control over his music and career.<br>
He released The Rainwater LP that year. "Let the Drummer Kick" from his 2002 album Citizen Cope achieved RIAA gold disc status. Greenwood released his following album, One Lovely Day on July 17, 2012.</p1>
